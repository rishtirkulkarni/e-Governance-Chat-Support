# e-Governance-Chat-Support
This project aims to provide a platform where citizens a who are facing a problem can directly contact concerned government officials. <br> Though this is a prototype, we can develop on the idea and make it an impactful website which can bring about a change in the administration. <br>Me and my team worked on this project as a part of Samsung India Hackathon.<br>
